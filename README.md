I would like to highlight that I have loaded the csv data into a spark dataframe. Due to constraints in my company laptop, I cannot setup SQL database locally with outside data.
However, I know how to connect SQL database with spark dataframe, or how to load a csv data into a database table and then to spark dataframe.

The zip file contains the jupyter notebook containing the code for the analysis of given dataset.
